#This is a Gatsby.js Starter configured to my preferences

Note that I am utilizing an enhanced GraphQL playground. In order to initialize, you need to add a file called '.env.development' at the root and paste in the following: GATSBY_GRAPHQL_IDE=playground

To run the playground while developing, instead of using gatsby develop, use npm run develop

This starter is meant to be used with TailwindCSS and Tailwind has been configured. You can use Tailwind like normal, but since this is React you need to use className instead of class.
